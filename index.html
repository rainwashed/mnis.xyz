                    East and partake in the art's program here.

                <h3><i>Why did I take art?</i></h3>
                <p>
                    I took art mostly due to the fact that I have never in the
                    past and I wanted to try something new for once. Also I
                    could not participate in other electives such as band and
                    orchestra due to my lack of experience in those electives so
                    art was my only choice.

                <h3><i>What is art?</i></h3>
                <p>
                    Art is a language spoken before any. It is a source for
                    history, culture, religion, and other ideas that can simply
                    not be spoken, but only shown. Art is the proxy between
                    ideas and understanding; it can turn ideas into a median
                    language known as "art" which can then be understood. It
                    was, and still is, the language with no words.

                    <p>
                        MYP Arts (stands for Middle Year Program Arts) is a
                        program offered by International Academy to teach
                        students about art. MYP, more precisely, MYP1, is the
                        first year of Art at International Academy. This is an
                        intro to art, both for those who have past experiences
                        and those who don't. It teaches the fundamentals of art,
                        analyzing art, and the process and mindset needed to
                        create a work.
