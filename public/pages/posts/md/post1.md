-   Title: A Simple Cover
-   Subject Matter: My Art Hardcover Journal
-   Medium: I used a mechanical pencil for the rough sketch outline and black sharpie for the rest
-   Project Goal: A simplified design with a small Zentangle drawing in the center

### My artwork takes great use of lines, form, and texture.

**Lines** were the main outline for my design with most lines being completely straight. (I had used a ruler to precisely measure and draw) \
**Form** was used as the design revolved around a 3-dimensional hexagon, with a smaller cube inside the center of the hexagon, giving it a trippy effect. \
**Texture** came in the form of both implied and physical. The pencil marks on the right makes it look rough, and if you were to feel the cover, it would also feel rough. The center can also be felt due to the hard pressure I had put on it when making the outline, though it cannot be seen.

### Also there are massive amounts of contrast and patterns.

The **contrast** comes from the fact that I had only used black sharpie when the cover was white, creating a center point of contrast with all the designs in black. \
The **patterns** were each "face" of the 3-dimensional hexagon with their own repeated design as to create an **uncomplicated** design.

I believed that the creation of this artwork boosted my confidence in the field of art, since coming into art, I knew nothing. Classmates has noted how my design looked very nice, and it made me feel good inside. I feel that my artwork is heavily inspired by this one game called "Antichamer", a non-euclidean puzzle game. The game mostly only features the colors of black and white, and create space in such a way that does not feel real to our universe, which inspired me to create the cube inside the hexagon to try to create that "non-euclidean" feel to it. I tried my best to replicate that design, but if I could go back again, I'd try harder with more knowledge on non-euclidean spaces. I'd also want to try not making mistakes with the sharpie, but that only comes from muscle memory.

I believe that the function of my artwork is to be a point of identity, of me as an artist. I'm into geometric art, even if within the art itself it has no meaning, it has meaning to me. It is my interest, my "style" of art, and what I enjoy drawing. This cover is simply a form of expression of my interests, I can create the art that I want in the style that I like. That is what I like about Zentangling; there are not many rules except "just art". In the end, however, the meaning is just what you see it as.
